Per Apache policy, all Druid committers are required to have a contributor license agreement (CLA) on file with
the Apache Software Foundation.

Other contributors are free to submit patches without having a CLA on file. You should only submit patches to the
project when you intend to license your contribution under the Apache 2.0 license, and have the legal right to do so.
